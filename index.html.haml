              At the start of 2012, I joined Gainesville's hackerspace
              "Skillhouse" and was soon asked to be on the Board of Directors.
              Being part of that environment quickly led me to a career in web
              development. Fast forward to now and I'm a full time Ruby on
              Rails developer at a startup that is quickly leaving its
              infancy.

                  Created a custom analytics app allowing each user session
                  to be analyzed. By logging each controller#action, this app
                  enabled User Support to diagnose problems quicker, as well as
                  allow developers to determine the most used features of the
                  site.

                  Duplicate user registration was occuring with nearly 50% of
                  new users. Simplifying the registration process by utilizing
                  Ajax to combine multiple forms into one reduced this to less
                  than 5%.

                  Co-organized and taught a Beginner's Arduino class. In four
                  hours, a group of 20 participants learned how to interface with
                  an Arduino, move servos, use RGB leds, and make noise by taking
                  input from sensors.

                , to develop the site. I continued consulting with KarmaSapien to make small fixes and improvements to the site.

                A very simple app for quickly tracking calories. I have a
                tendency to try and record far too many details. This causes me
                to stop recording quickly as it becomes too much of a hassle. I
                created this app to only have a simple form and a simple
                display so that I would simply use it.
